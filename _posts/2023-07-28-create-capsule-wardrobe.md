## Basic tops
For this you want to get a few go-to tops in each style: tank, t-shirt, even an oversized or menswear shirt. You want these to emulate the effortless but trendy vibes that the Skims cotton and fits everybody collections have. You want basic tops and t-shirts of various neutral colours that you’ll be able to dress up and down depending on the occasion and be able to swap them in and out of different outfits. A good basic top can be worn everyday with jeans for a laid back look, out for drinks with the girls with a pair of heels and leather trousers, or even in the office with a corporate blazer and wide leg trousers. They really can be worn in any situation. It’s all about accessorizing. 

Some of the best basic tops can be found from H&M, Skims, Uniqlo and Stradivarius. 

## Jeans 
A straight leg jean is the safest bet at keeping up with trends, these never really go out of style. Personally, I love a flared jean as I feel they complement my body shape the best. Another good option is a mum or boyfriend jean as these can easily be dressed up and down. Regardless of what style of jean you opt for, make sure it’s one that you’re comfortable and confident in. There’s no point in ditching all your favourite jeans for one style that’s trendy right now, it could be out of fashion in a few months – if you don’t love it, ditch it. 

I swear by River Island for the best-fitting flared jeans that will give you a JLO booty - or as close as I’ll ever come to one. Other good places for jeans are Pull and Bear, Levi (the OG), and Zara (prepare to get your feelings hurt with the sizing).

## Wide leg trousers 
These are your best friends next to your jeans. There are some occasions where jeans just might not cut it, particularly in professional settings. A good pair of long wide leg trousers are ideal for office work outfits, but they retain a chic vibe to them that can be dressed up for trendy everyday looks and formal dinner outfits. For the office, pair these trousers with tucked in turtlenecks and a blazer. For the everyday, opt for tight fitting bodysuits or crop tops that can leave a bit of midriff bare above the trousers. 

Hit stores like Zara, Stradivarius, H&M, and ASOS.

## Everyday trainers 
You’ve got to hand it to them, trainers really have cemented themselves as the shoe of the 21st century. It seems no other footwear is so versatile. Running errands all day? Chuck on a pair of trainers. Need a casual shoe to finish off your office outfit? Put on some trainers. Going clubbing? Trainers. Gone are the days of tottering around in heels or day – and I can’t say I will particularly miss it. 

If you’re wondering what trainers to go for, look no further. A great everyday shoe that’s comfortable and you can colour match to your outfit is Nike Air Force 1s or Dunks. Want something that might be better for the office? Look no further than New Balance, especially their 530s and 2002rs. 

However, we can’t all get away with trainers at work. If your occupation is more on the professional side, I’d recommend investing in some good ballet pumps. These can look really trendy and professional, meaning you can wear them to work and out for drinks after. Surprisingly, you can find great finds for these at M&S or online at Amazon (which offer good dupes for the Chanel sling-back pumps).
